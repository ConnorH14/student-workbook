# REST

> What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST is a design pattern for APIs, and it stands for Representational State Transfer.

> What does Stateless mean?

Stateless means that the server doesn't remember previous requests and each request contains all the data needed.

> What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

URLs include nouns, not verbs. Plural nouns for consistency. Use HTTP methods and reponse codes.
