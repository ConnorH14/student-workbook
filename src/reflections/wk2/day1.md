# Javascript Variables

> Scope of Variables

Scope is where a variable can be used, scope can be global or local.

> Hoisting

Hoisting determines where variable declarations are put on the page before the code is ran.

> In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Vars can be declared globally, let and cont's scopes are blocked. Cont is used when the value of the variable shouldn't change, a value in a const object can be changed.
