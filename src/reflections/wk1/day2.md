> Pseudo-Classes

Pseudo classes are used to select an element when its in a certain state. Common pseudo classes would be hover and link.

> Specificity

Specificity is what CSS uses to determine which effect should be applied to an element when it is targeted by 2 different properties. It allows you to target many elements with broader selectors and then change them at a closer level by being specific with the selector. 

> !important

The !important property overrides any specificity from all linked stylesheets. You can run into issues using it if there is more than 1 !important property applied to an element. Using it is typically bad practice.
