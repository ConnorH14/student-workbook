# Wire-Framing

> What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wire-framing is used to develop a layout of a website before writing any actual code. Wire-frames are quick and cheap to make.

> What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Wireframes can have multiple levels of detail, from pen and paper to using special design software to wireframe. Each level is useful for visualization of the site and gets more accurate to the final design.

> Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Absolutely, they are relatively quick to make and let clients see the product before time and resources go into developing code for the site.
