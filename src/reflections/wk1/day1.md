# What is git?

 Git is a source control solution. Git manages changes that are made to a project, and allows the user to return to older verisons of the code.

 > Branches

 Branches in git are useful because they allow developers to work and update a project for testing without having to use the code from the main branch.

 > Git vs GitHub

 Git is seperate from GitHub, git is the source control solution. GitHub provides hosting for coding projects and allows the usage of git as the source controller.
