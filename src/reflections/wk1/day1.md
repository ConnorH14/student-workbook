# What is git?

 Git is a source control solution. Git manages changes that are made to a project, and allows the user to return to older verisons of the code.

 Branches in git are useful because they allow developers to work and update a project for testing without having to use the code from the main branch.

 Git is seperate from GitHub, git is the source control solution. GitHub provides hosting for coding projects and allows the usage of git as the source controller.
