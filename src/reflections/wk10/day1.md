> What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value, reference, and pointer.

> What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

Value types hold a value that is directly associated with the variable.

> In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types don't store a value, but instead an address of where the value that they are pointing to is stored.
