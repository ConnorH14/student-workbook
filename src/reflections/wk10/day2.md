# CS Lists

> What is a List in C#?

Lists store a sequence of values in order.

> What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

.containes and .clear are two of the methods that I think I will use.

> How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

You can use a .find for lists.
