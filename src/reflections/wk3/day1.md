> What problem does using exports solve?

Instead of having to get a new HTTP request for each script document, the main script file can include code snippets from other files which makes page performance faster.

> How does export differ from export default?

Regular export allows you to send in values determined by your code. Export default exports default values if no values are given in its place.

> What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Code is split into smaller parts. It makes code easier to read for debugging. They help with avoiding naming conflicts.
