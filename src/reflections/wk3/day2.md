# Encapsulation

> What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation splits code up into many smaller parts to be used as they are needed. It only allows certain parts of code to access it for security.

> What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Closure and the underscore prefix conflict with eachother.

> How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

We add an underscore before the function name because of convention and readibility.
